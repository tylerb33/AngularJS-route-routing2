	"description": "Blue Ridge Parkway is reputed to have the most scenic views of any other drive in America; along 469 miles, the Parkway travels through lush forest lands, blooming meadows, and boasts some of the most beautiful panoramic views in the east. Head down to North Carolina where the route travels along the Blue Ridge in the Appalachian Mountains for the most stunning landscape scenery, or make your way to the Linn Cove Viaduct, a 1,243-foot bridge that snakes around the bottom of Grandfather Mountain. If you’re yearning for a stop, check out Asheville – North Carolina’s historic gem nestled in the Appalachian Mountains."
