	"name": "Highway 12 - Utah",
	"description": "Highway 12 is Utah‘s most famous scenic byway lined with pine trees and red sandstone cliffs that make for a peaceful setting. Built in 1914 as a ‘forest road,’ Highway 12 was known as rugged terrain until it received a newly paved road through Boulder Mountain in 1985; since its initial construction in the early 1900s, it has received many other reconstructions and extensions – starting in Bryce Canyon, the road now heads through Dixie National Forest to Capitol Reef National Park. Be sure to take in the natural beauty of Red Rock country while perusing through the rocky mountainside."
